In honor of Veterans Day we are posting early a history film from the Department of the Army.  This film relates the African American experience in World War II and how things changed in the US Army at the time.  We have to acknowledge our history, warts and all, as we march bravely into the future.  If we do not we are doomed to repeat mistakes of the past.

We honor all warfighters on this Veterans Day.
