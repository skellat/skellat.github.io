summary: "Switching gears with this pick, we wind up turning to Rocky Jones.  This is a glimpse at a future that never was.  The concept of a Secretary of Space is kinda nice and perhaps we may end up adopting that some day in our own timeline.  This is a 1950s retro romp through the galaxy so prepare for blast off!"
