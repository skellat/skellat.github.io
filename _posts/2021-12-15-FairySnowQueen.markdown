Before today's cookie cutter holiday films from a certain television network named for a greeting card company it seems filmmakers of the past liked to indulge in making what can best be described as nightmare fuel.  This short comes from producer Sid Davis who is more well known for quite heavy-handed productions in the educational films realm.  This is **not** the version available [riffed by the guys at RiffTrax](https://www.rifftrax.com/santa-and-the-fairy-snow-queen) as their print cuts a whole ten minutes or so.  

You can always watch [Rollergator](https://youtu.be/pKesdLhMTcM) if this one didn't work too well for you.
