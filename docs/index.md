## Supporting A Vibrant Local Media Environment

A continuing research effort on our part is to look at venturing into the creation of microfilm works as well as establishing our own small press.  Our local media environment is growing darker.  We are looking for ways to keep the light of knowledge lit.  The radio landscape is also becoming less responsive to local needs which requires us to look at innovative ways to respond.  

Revival of the notion of community Wi-Fi networks may become necessary over time due to the tightening of the traditional media landscape removing much chance for new players in broadcast to emerge.  We may need to look at what can be done to interface with Wi-Fi tabletop radios and other such devices on the market.  If an apapropriate engineering plan can be developed a metro LAN to allow for a more localized sort of broadcast system may be required although the need for a Special Temporary Authority permit from the Federal Communications Commission will have to be assessed.

## Our Recent Works

### Support of Yester-Tech LLC 

We were proud to have the opportunity to support [Yester-Tech LLC](http://www.yester-tech.com/) with a custom multimedia display at a small business tradeshow on Black Friday 2019 in Eastlake, Ohio.  We deployed open source software using the [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org/) Linux distribution on a suitably configured Raspbbery Pi device in the field.  This was a rapid-deployment project for us with minimum turnaround.

### Over The Air Reception

We have been experimenting with various styles of receiving television signals.  With the recent "channel repack" the landscape has changed a bit as to what we now can receive.  Displayed channel numbers on a television screen for Over The Air stations don't necessarily have to match the actual RF channels in use.

This works helps us explain to clients the engineering limits of our constantly changing over-the-air television broadcast environment.

### KCRW 7th Radio Race (2019)

We had the opportunity to participate in the KCRW Radio Race which is part of the station's Independent Producer Project.  The submitted piece was entitled: "When Local Media Isn't Truly Local".  The track is [available for download from SoundCloud for listening](https://soundcloud.com/alpacaherder/radio-race-2019-when-local-media-isnt-truly-local).  We didn't win but were happy to have the chance to participate with a submission that certainly did not simply fit the mold the rest of the pack did.

We look forward to next year's competition.   

### Continuing Experimentation

We do attempt to keep track of developments in the realm of microcontrollers and single board computers.  These are important items that help drive various aspects of our work.  Pictured is an original mark Raspberry Pi B that is being configured for "headless" operation.
