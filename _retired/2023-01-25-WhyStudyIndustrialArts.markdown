This is one of the classic shorts riffed by the crew of the Satellite of Love on *Mystery Science Theater 3000*.  It was specifically riffed as part of Experiment 609 -- The Skydivers.  This rendition is not riffed, though.

If *The Skydivers* sounds vaguely familiar, you're remembering it as part of the Coleman Francis trilogy of films.  This short came before that film.  We *may* approach that film another day.
