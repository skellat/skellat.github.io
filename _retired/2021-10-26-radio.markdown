This is a film out of the [Academic Film Archive of North America](http://www.afana.org/watchfilms.htm).  They work to snag films heading for destruction so that they can be preserved.  These aren't necessarily the same as the [Coronet and Centron films](https://www.rifftrax.com/catalog/product-type/shorts/collection/shorts) that the folks at [RiffTrax](https://www.rifftrax.com/) work with.
