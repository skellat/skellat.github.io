summary: "In this episode of the Computer Chronicles we take a look at the state of multitasking as it was in 1988.  At that time you had players like A/UX from Apple, Xenix from Tandy, Concurrent DOS from Digital Research, Windows 386 from Microsoft, and OS/2 from IBM.  The field does not look like that today."
