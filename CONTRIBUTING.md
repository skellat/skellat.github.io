CONTRIBUTING
============

Substantive external contributions are not accepted for the foreseeable future.  

Programming requests may be filed via issues once that function is enabled on GitHub.  

Financial contributions are always accepted.  They are not tax-deductible, though.  

Consult <erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.
