CONTRIBUTING
============

Substantive external contributions remain out of bounds for the foreseeable future.  

Programming requests may be filed via issues once that function is enabled on GitHub.  

Financial contributions are always accepted.  They are not tax-deductible under the laws of the USA.

Consult <erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.
