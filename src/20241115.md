The nomination of RFK Jr. to be Secretary of Health and Human Services is quite dangerous.  Will this impact the ability of providers to treat The Unmentionable Condition?  Oh, more than likely.  I can't see this guy allowing the Orphan Drug Act to properly operate let alone [other resources in HHS](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/resources) of special interest to me.

We've progressed beyond the clown car to something more insidious.  I'm not even show what to term it.  This is just bad overall.

The passport should be arriving soon.  This helps move plans forward.

Is it time to cross the Rubicon?  It seems so if they let this craziness proceed.  I can't take bets on whether or not the badness will happen but right now this isn't making much sense.
