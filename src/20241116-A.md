My passport arrived Friday.  This is very much **a good thing**.  This allows evacuation planning to proceed.

The clown car continues to fill up as the new administration continues to take form and shape.  Frankly this is horrifying.

This weeks edition of *The Gazette* showed up late as it was in the mailbox Friday instead of Thursday.  We're seeing the death of news play out before us here in Ashtabula County.  The problem is that for the most part *people don't care locally*.  Having a dearth of active news entities also corresponds to high voter turnout for Donald Trump and that hypothesis is born out here in Ashtabula County.

I'm not sure what all is coming.  That simply seem to be dark clouds on the horizon.  Optimism seems totally out of place at this time.
