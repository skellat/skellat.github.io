**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

It is not a good thing to comply with the demands of an authoritarian dictator.  We are promised oppression by the incoming Trump-Vance administration.  As long as there are means to use technology of all sorts to cope with the situation we might endure.  This doesn't mean that we necessarily need to create new technologies necessarily.  Using older tactics, techniques, and procedures in new ways may be just as effective.

The main question is how to apply those tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Preparing for a more offline world that is rooted more in store-and-forward paradigms may become necessary.  Whipping out 56k modems to pass highly compressed data point to point may get past blockades of the Internet, for example.  Radio data transmissions such as those done by the [Shortwave Radiogram program](https://swradiogram.net) will also help bridge gaps.  Effectively wielding these tools will be an important measure in 2025 and following.

Making our way through this massive change will not necessarily be simple.  Preparation will be key to survival, though.
