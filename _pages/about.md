The Ashtabula area lacks its own broadcast television station.  There are limited cablecast efforts in the cities of Conneaut and Ashtabula to provide some television programs.  This is an attempt at providing programming accessible to the entire county without a subscription to a monopoly cable television service.  

Presently shows can be watched from your own computer as well as via any device that supports Apple Podcasts (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac) and any Android device that supports AntennaPod.  There may be other devices out there that we simply *do not know about* so the basic RSS feed is also available to import manually.  We haven't nailed down Roku support but casting from your Android device or Apple device to the Roku should work.

This is presently an iterative effort so please expect changes as time goes by.  That is to say, this is a work in progress.
