The Ashtabula area lacks its own broadcast television station serving the *entire* county.  There are limited cablecast efforts in the cities of Conneaut and Ashtabula to provide *some* television programs.  This is an attempt at providing programming accessible to the entire county without a subscription to a [monopoly cable television service](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cable_television&oldid=7493434).  

We have an entire page dedicated to how [you can enjoy this service]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/howtouse.html) on your computer, phone, tablet, and television.  The directions there should get you started in terms of making use of this.  There is no single way to enjoy these programs so take advantage of the many opportunities available.

Currently there is no advertising in our programming.  This work is not a tax-deductible effort but contributions are accepted to help fuel our growth.  Contact [Erie Looking Productions](https://erielookingproductions.info) for further details or utilize [PayPal](https://paypal.me/erielooking) to directly contribute.

Even though remains an *experimental* offering it is in suspension due to the present Russia-Ukraine conflict.  We're focusing on cyber-security concerns at this point and that is eating up a few too many resources.  We apologize for any difficulties caused.  We expect to resume operation of this service post-conflict.
