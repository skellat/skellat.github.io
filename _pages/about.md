The Ashtabula area lacks its own broadcast television station serving the *entire* county.  There are limited cablecast efforts in the cities of Conneaut and Ashtabula to provide some television programs.  This is an attempt at providing programming accessible to the entire county without a subscription to a monopoly cable television service.  

We have an entire page dedicated to how [you can enjoy this service]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/howtouse.html) on your computer, phone, tablet, and television.  The directions there should get you started in terms of making use of this.

Currently there is no advertising in our programming.  This work is not a tax-deductible effort but contributions are accepted to help fuel our growth.
