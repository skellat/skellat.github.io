We plan to bring weather report programs for the Ashtabula area.  Other programming is planned to follow once resources permit.  Weather recaps are planned to be released on a daily basis although we *currently* are making experimental releases from time to time.  Until that totally launches we will be priming the feed by pointing to various public domain items on the Internet Archive.

There is an entire page dedicated to how [you can enjoy this service]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/howtouse.html) on your computer, phone, tablet, and television.  The directions there *should* get you started in terms of making use of this service.  There is no single way to enjoy these programs so take advantage of the many opportunities available.

Financial support to this work can be provided through [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/smkellat) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/smkellat).  There are currently no advertising spots shown in our programming.  This work is *not* a tax-deductible effort but contributions **are** accepted to help fuel our growth.
