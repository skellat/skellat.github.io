=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting as soon as possible.  Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for further details.
