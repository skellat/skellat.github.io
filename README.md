This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is made normally using VS Code.

Notwithstanding the [continuing situation in Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) we are partially resuming operations.  Offensive cyber operations haven't shown up as any of us expected.  They could still come but we can stand down from alert after three months, I think.

Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.  We expect to resume **full capacity** operations after the conclusion of the conflict, *whenever that may be*.
