The Coyote Works
=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting as soon as possible.  Increasingly we're using [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) too.  Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for further details about us.

We continue to work on getting locally-produced programming up and running.  Right now this runs inconsistently in parallel with [69 Admins](https://69admins.com).  It is uncertain which will be the dominant effort in the long run but presently it seems like 69 Admins will be.

Requests and suggestions as to programming should be made via [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/skellat/skellat.github.io/issues).  Follow the template posted there.  Failure to follow the template there may result in summary closure of an issue.  We're working hard to get things working right.  Not everything work correctly, though.

Why the domain name?  One of the people behind the site worked as a civil servant during the presidency of the Very Stable Genius.  The Very Stable Genius resembled a [certain "genius" cartoon character that chased a certain bird around the vast American western desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner&oldid=1139080276)...
