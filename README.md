This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting eventually.

In 2023 we are moving toward declaring operational readiness to properly serve the public.  There is definitely more to come.  Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for further details.
