The Coyote Works
=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting eventually.

This site sees irregular periods of inaction.  We are pushing forward until we can be ready to fully launch to the public.  Getting more content produced is still a problem, alas.
