The Coyote Works
=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting eventually.

This site sees irregular periods of inaction.  Until we can get to a point where we can properly do video streaming this shall remain an *interim* step.  Spinning up content production to post to the Internet Archive is the next phase after all the practice just pointing to things already there.
