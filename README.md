Coyote Works
============

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking 
behind the curtain.

Eventually local productions from Ashtabula will be added.  A successful 
systems test for chroma key action on December 9th may allow us to begin 
production soon.

What may local production include?  At this point it will involve 
reading the weather report.  Data gathering code for that can be found 
at <https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/nws-data-gathering>.  Then 
again, it might not based upon some things said by a meteorologist down 
at WJW in Cleveland.
  
Financial contributions are always accepted.  They are definitely not 
tax-deductible, though.

Consult <erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.
