This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is normally modified using VS Code (both the downloaded version and github.dev) though we hope to create shell scripting as soon as possible.  Increasingly we're using [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) too.  Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for further details about us.

Requests and suggestions as to programming should be made via [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/skellat/skellat.github.io/issues).  Follow the template posted there.
