The Coyote Works
=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is generally made using VS Code.

The world may still be mad yet we are still not operating at full power.  We will do what we can.  Presently this is just an *interim* step on the way to something else.  This **will** see intermittent periods of inaction arise more than I would generally prefer.  Eventually we're going to shift to free ad-support streaming television as an operating model but that's not an immediate possibility.
