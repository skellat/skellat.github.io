This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is made normally using VS Code.

Due to the [continuing situation in Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) we are suspending operations for the time being.  There are bigger fish to fry.  The blog for Stephen Michael Kellat is hidden within this site as a sort of reverse trap street.

Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.  We expect to resume operating after the conclusion of the conflict, *whenever that may be*.
