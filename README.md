The Coyote Works
=================

This is the Jekyll tooling for the video "podcast" site.  You're peeking behind the curtain.  This is made normally using VS Code.

Due to the [continuing situation in Ukraine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) we are suspending operations for the time being.  It has become evident that cyber operations have been taking place.  Entities in the United States have been impacted indirectly as far as we have been able to observe.  We can either keep up with mitigations or we can keep up with running the site.  For now we're choosing to keep up with mitigations.

Consult <https://erielookingproductions.info> for details on how to contact us.  We expect to resume operating after the conclusion of the conflict, *whenever that may be*.
