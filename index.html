ELP TV is a renegade attempt at Ashtabula-area television powered by resources at the Internet Archive.  Shows can be viewed by clicking on episode titles and watching them on your computer.  You can also watch shows via Apple devices (i.e. iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Macbook, Apple TV) using the link for Apple Podcasts.  On Android devices the link for AntennaPod will get you set up with a tool that will help you access shows.  We don't presently have direct support for Roku devices but shows can be "casted" from Apple and Android devices back to the Roku for display on a television.
