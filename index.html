ELP TV is an attempt at Ashtabula-area television.  It is powered by resources at the Internet Archive.  Most shows are public domain classics for the moment while additional material will be added over time.

Shows can be viewed by clicking on episode titles and watching them on your computer.  You can also watch shows via Apple devices (i.e. iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Macbook, Apple TV) using the link for Apple Podcasts.  On Android devices the link for AntennaPod will get you set up with a tool that will help you access shows.  We don't presently have direct support for Roku devices but shows can be "casted" from Apple and Android devices back to the Roku for display on a television.  In any other case you will want to use the RSS feed to follow along.
