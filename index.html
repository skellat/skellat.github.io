<h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3>
<p>Erie Looking Productions is based in Ashtabula, Ohio.  We are a boutique multi-platform media arts shop available for contract work.  From work in <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX2e</a> to audio production to video editing, we provide unique solutions for you. Examples of audio works we have created can be found online at the <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22Erie%20Looking%20Productions%22&amp;and[]=mediatype%3A%22audio%22">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>If you're looking for the blog of Stephen Michael Kellat, please head over instead to <a href="http://coyote.works/">Coyote Works</a> which is powered using the excellent <a href="https://ikiwiki.info/">ikiwiki</a> back-end.  Fiction works by Stephen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Michael-Kellat/e/B085MR8Y8J">are currently available for purchase via Amazon</a> in print and on the Kindle platform.  </p>

<h3 id="to-reach-us">To Reach Us</h3>
<p>For more information as well as price quotes, please contact us <a href="skype:stephen.michael.kellat?chat">via Skype</a>.  Our rather secondary presence on Facebook can be found at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/erielooking/">https://www.facebook.com/erielooking/</a> and we generally prefer to operate outside the hegemonic realm of the House of Zuckerberg.  </p>
<h2 id="serving-you-in-the-covid-19-crisis">Serving You In The COVID-19 Crisis</h2>
<p>Although much of the business world was disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis, we continue to stand in the gap to assist others.  We have been proud to be able to assist in ecclesiastical matters during the crisis.  Whether it is looking up scriptural references in response to inquiries from bible class teachers handling prep or handling the logistics of a “drive-in” church service, we’ve stood in the gap.  </p>
<p>We recorded condensed worship services for a variety of video platforms on short turnaround in April 2020.  We resumed production of online worship in early November 2020.  Typesetting of worship materials using LaTeX2e is one of our specialties that we have had to leverage repeatedly.  Utilizing thorough knowledge of radio frequency tech we even got a church parking lot rigged legally for FM sound temporarily for drive-in services in May 2020.  These solutions and more have been part of our work during this crisis.  </p>
<p>In a time of many questions we can offer solutions to at least some of your problems.  We may not be a traditional partner that you would consider but in these times of change are problem-solvers worth considering.  Contact us for a consultation.  </p>
<h2 id="regular-commercial-services-offered">Regular Commercial Services Offered</h2>
<p>We offer many services on a general commercial basis.  During the COVID-19 crisis we may not necessarily be able to fulfill all service requests.  Please contact us to discuss the availability of services.</p>

<h2 id="works-in-progress">Works in Progress</h2>
<h3 id="supporting-a-vibrant-yet-local-cultural-arts-environment">Supporting A Vibrant Yet Local Cultural Arts Environment</h3>
<p>Our media environment is collapsing locally.  The Save Our Stages Act is not making progress in Washington.  Efforts are underway to launch a streaming video channel to try to bridge gaps in access for cultural arts output in our county.  When the arts center cannot fill more than fifteen percent of its seats there is a problem to be addressed.  Unfortunately there are no easy answers to this.</p>
<h3 id="other-efforts">Other Efforts</h3>
<p>We have a variety of general matters that are works in progress before us.  Due to the COVID-19 crisis we may not be able to proceed expeditiously in concluding these matters.  Works include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of new podcasting projects as well as development of audiovisual streaming using <a href="https://snapcraft.io/obs-studio">OBS Studio</a>  </li>
<li>Continued experimentation in optimal Over The Air television receiver systems design  </li>
<li>Writing and review of various fictional works </li>
<li>Monitoring of submissions to various outlets  </li>
<li>Responding to Federal Communications Commission proceedings as appropriate  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-recent-works">Our Recent Works</h2>
<h3 id="support-of-yester-tech-llc">Support of Yester-Tech LLC</h3>
<p>We were proud to have the opportunity to support <a href="http://www.yester-tech.com/">Yester-Tech LLC</a> with a custom multimedia display at a small business tradeshow on Black Friday 2019 in Eastlake, Ohio.  We deployed open source software using the <a href="http://raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> Linux distribution on a suitably configured Raspbbery Pi device in the field.  This was a rapid-deployment project for us with minimum turnaround.</p>

<h3 id="over-the-air-reception">Over The Air Reception</h3>
<p>We have been experimenting with various styles of receiving television signals.  With the recent "channel repack" the landscape has changed a bit as to what we now can receive.  Displayed channel numbers on a television screen for Over The Air stations don't necessarily have to match the actual RF channels in use.  This work helps us explain to clients the engineering limits of our constantly changing over-the-air television broadcast environment.</p>
<h3 id="kcrw-7th-radio-race-2019">KCRW 7th Radio Race (2019)</h3>
<p>We had the opportunity to participate in the KCRW Radio Race which is part of the station's Independent Producer Project.  The submitted piece was entitled: "When Local Media Isn't Truly Local".  The track is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alpacaherder/radio-race-2019-when-local-media-isnt-truly-local">available for download from SoundCloud for listening</a>.  We didn't win but were happy to have the chance to participate with a submission that certainly did not simply fit the mold the rest of the pack did.  We look forward to next year's competition.   </p>
<h3 id="continuing-experimentation">Continuing Experimentation</h3>
<p>We do attempt to keep track of developments in the realm of microcontrollers and single board computers.  These are important items that help drive various aspects of our work.  The primary software in use was <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit">gitit</a> which is a somewhat lower-impact wiki compared to other options out there.  We are in the midst of a pivot to instead build a solution set for recording television programs using <a href="https://tvheadend.org/">Tvheadend</a>.</p>
