<h2 id="works-in-progress">Works in Progress</h2>
<h3 id="supporting-a-vibrant-local-media-environment">Supporting A Vibrant Local Media Environment</h3>
<p>A continuing research effort on our part is to look at venturing into the creation of microfilm works as well as establishing our own small press.  Our local media environment is growing darker.  We are looking for ways to keep the light of knowledge lit.  The radio landscape is also becoming less responsive to local needs which requires us to look at innovative ways to respond.  </p>
<p>We recognize that during the COVID-19 crisis there are radio stations, television stations, and newspapers dying across the country.  Ashtabula County is at a very special risk of losing any "local" media.  It is with abject horror that we have watched newspaper chain after newspaper chain shutter titles in both their print and online forms since the start of this crisis.  The horror only continues as we see the list of radio stations seeking special temporary authority from Federal Communications Commission to go into extended silent periods get longer and longer.</p>
<p>Eventually we will need to prepare and present a post-crisis plan for a new media future for Ashtabula in terms of our community having a locally-originated media.  Cleveland-area outlets ignored our community prior to the crisis and with them all being at reduced strength they will not be in a position to provide us with coverage and reporting.  When Lake County is being referred to as "outlying" and "distant" to Cleveland perhaps Ashtabula County is on the dark side of the Moon?</p>
<h3 id="other-efforts">Other Efforts</h3>
<p>We have a variety of general matters that are works in progress before us.  Due to the COVID-19 crisis we may not be able to proceed expeditiously in concluding these matters.  Works include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of a short film concerning an Internet outage in the Pacific  </li>
<li>Development of a short film about all the churches in the Ashtabula area that are closing or have buildings up for sale  </li>
<li>Finishing an artsy short film for the <a href="https://damshortfilm.org/">Dam Short Film Festival</a> about views on perspective  </li>
<li>Re-work of other short film efforts for later submission to <a href="https://filmfreeway.com/festivals?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;config%5B%5D=call_for_entries&amp;config%5B%5D=event_type&amp;config%5B%5D=niches&amp;config%5B%5D=entry_fees&amp;config%5B%5D=years_running&amp;config%5B%5D=runtime&amp;config%5B%5D=submit&amp;has_query=&amp;q=&amp;call_for_entries=1&amp;ft_gold=0&amp;ft_ff=0&amp;ft_ff=1&amp;ft_sc=0&amp;ft_audio=0&amp;ft_photo=0&amp;ft_oe=0&amp;project_category%5B%5D=9&amp;fees=0%3B50&amp;years=4%3B20&amp;runtime=Any&amp;inside_or_outside_country=0&amp;countries=us&amp;entry_deadline_when=0&amp;entry_deadline=&amp;event_date_when=0&amp;event_date=&amp;sort=event_date">appropriate film festivals</a>  </li>
<li>Development of new podcasting projects as well as development of audiovisual streaming using <a href="https://snapcraft.io/obs-studio">OBS Studio</a>  </li>
<li>Continued experimentation in optimal Over The Air television receiver systems design  </li>
<li>Writing and review of various fictional works </li>
<li>Monitoring of submissions to various outlets  </li>
<li>Responding to Federal Communications Commission proceedings as appropriate  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-recent-works">Our Recent Works</h2>
<h3 id="support-of-yester-tech-llc">Support of Yester-Tech LLC</h3>
<p>We were proud to have the opportunity to support <a href="http://www.yester-tech.com/">Yester-Tech LLC</a> with a custom multimedia display at a small business tradeshow on Black Friday 2019 in Eastlake, Ohio.  We deployed open source software using the <a href="http://raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> Linux distribution on a suitably configured Raspbbery Pi device in the field.  This was a rapid-deployment project for us with minimum turnaround.</p>
<p><img alt="Slide" src="../img/slide.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Our credit slide from the multimedia show</em>  </p>
<h3 id="over-the-air-reception">Over The Air Reception</h3>
<p>We have been experimenting with various styles of receiving television signals.  With the recent "channel repack" the landscape has changed a bit as to what we now can receive.  Displayed channel numbers on a television screen for Over The Air stations don't necessarily have to match the actual RF channels in use.</p>

<p><img alt="ScreencapB" src="../img/NewTV-shrunk.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>An example of current Over The Air reception.</em></p>
<p>This work helps us explain to clients the engineering limits of our constantly changing over-the-air television broadcast environment.</p>
<h3 id="kcrw-7th-radio-race-2019">KCRW 7th Radio Race (2019)</h3>
<p>We had the opportunity to participate in the KCRW Radio Race which is part of the station's Independent Producer Project.  The submitted piece was entitled: "When Local Media Isn't Truly Local".  The track is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alpacaherder/radio-race-2019-when-local-media-isnt-truly-local">available for download from SoundCloud for listening</a>.  We didn't win but were happy to have the chance to participate with a submission that certainly did not simply fit the mold the rest of the pack did.</p>
<p><img alt="Soundcloud" src="../img/KCRW-shrunk.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>A view of the track in the SoundCloud interface.</em></p>
<p>We look forward to next year's competition.   </p>
<h3 id="continuing-experimentation">Continuing Experimentation</h3>
<p>We do attempt to keep track of developments in the realm of microcontrollers and single board computers.  These are important items that help drive various aspects of our work.  Pictured is an original mark Raspberry Pi B that is being configured for "headless" operation.  The primary software in use is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit">gitit</a> which is a somewhat lower-impact wiki compared to other options out there.</p>
