# The Hot Zone 

A more complete picture is used quite often beyond the [CDC count                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   dash](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=Ohio&data-type=Risk&list_select_county=39007) but presently Ashtabula County is one of two Ohio counties running high on CDC's *new* metrics for coronavirus spread.  The risk is pretty high here.  I'll be curious as to [Ohio wastewater levels](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/dashboards/other-resources/wastewater) tomorrow too.
