# Heading Into A Holiday

In no particular order:  

* Thursday was a travel day that involved me visiting sites in Cuyahoga and Lake counties.
* [Erie Looking Productions](https://erielookingproductions.info) now has a pass-through HDMI capture device on-hand which may well help with creating instructional content.
* Mom's birthday is today.  I got her a large print Common English Bible hardcover as a birthday present.
* I am working on finalizing some production ideas as we head towards the third quarter of the year.  
* A feeling of being lost in the waves is developing again.
