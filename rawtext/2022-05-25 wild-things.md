# Where The Wild Things Are Not

In no particular order:  

* Statehouse redistricting [failed yet again](https://web.archive.org/web/20220525232657/https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2022-05-25/ohio-supreme-court-rejects-proposed-legislative-district-maps-for-fifth-time) here in Ohio.  This was expected.  
* I have joined a dating app.  It accuses me of being Canadian in my worldview.  I'm not sure what to do with this.  
* Even though there was a power outage in Geneva on Sunday we still managed to [stream services at church](https://youtu.be/M1ex-LFcTb0).  Not all of it made it online.  
* The church's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GCCGeneva/) is increasingly a better place to catch its live streams in place of YouTube, oddly enough.  
* I survived [being back in the pulpit preaching](https://twitter.com/GCCGeneva/status/1525844449540165634).
* Much remains on hold at the moment in life yet again.
