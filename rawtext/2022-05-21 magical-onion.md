# Magical Onion

Well, this was supposed to have been made an [Onion Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522031808/https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/) rather than a regular web site.  I didn't want to 
end up dealing with getting another domain name.  After we finished spending a few weeks watching *[Stitchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stitchers&oldid=1082866118)* I was figuring sticking 
something on the "dark web" alone would be worth a laugh at this point.  With all the mess in Russia with a newspaper even [resorting to making a *samizdat* edition to beat 
censorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20220521012308/https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-press-freedom-day-samizdat-perm-zvezda/31832108.html) it seems like a free and open web is on shaky ground.  

Other thoughts as to alternatives for electronic communications should occur.  Use of NNCP and UUCP probably should be planned for the future...
